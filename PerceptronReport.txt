Part III. You are welcome to reuse code you wrote for assignment 1,
but we would like to know how you handled the following tasks.

5. How did you calculate precision, recall and F1 score? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it.
=> I wrote a script to calculate the performance values. I have uploaded peformance.py, this file could be run in the following manner:
python3 performance.py <path of dev data> <path of output file>

6. How did you separate 10% of the training data? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it. Explain how you or your code choose the files.
=> I wrote a script to generate 10% training data. The files are randomly selected from the provided folder.
Name: 10percentgenerator.py
Run using: python3 10percentgenerator.py <path of training data>
